I am a recent graduate from the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur (May 2025), with a background in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. My work spans large language models, generative AI, and applied NLP systems. I have hands-on experience in fine-tuning and deploying models, as well as experimenting with efficient training techniques. You can explore my projects in detail on my [GitHub](https://github.com/mrbane10).
